            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a (mostly) self taught Backend Developer. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and started my career in the field, but I eventually decided that 
            the career path just wasn't for me. So I decided to shake off the coding rust and dive full on into the world of software engineering!
            </p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy most of the classic "nerd" hobbies like board games, comics, video games, etc. I also love to explore and travel the world. I 
            even combined these interests and hiked Mount Nguaruhoe (used as the stand-in for Mount Doom in <span class='font-italic'>The Lord of the Rings</span> films) in New Zealand.

            <h1>Work History</h1>
            <p>While studying at Purdue University, I did a three semester long co-op at the <a href="https://www.fnal.gov/">Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory</a> (aka Fermilab).
            Fermilab is one of America's premier particle physics research facilities and has had a plethora of contributions to the scientific community ranging from 
            discovering the top quark to the creation of Scientific Linux! As a co-op, I supported several projects across the site with things like CAD modeling,
            safety improvements, and structural test-stand design.
            </p>
            <p>After graduation, I began a full-time Engineering Manager position with <a href="https://us.pg.com/">Procter & Gamble</a> in Martinsburg, WV. 
            I was given the unique opportunity to help start up a brand new, world class manufacturing facility featuring the latest and greatest in consumer goods
            production technology. In the MPD (Materials, Process, and Delivery) group, my role was to ensure the successful transition of all packaging material 
            suppliers for the Swiffer refill business as we were starting our 12 new/relocated production lines.
            </p>
            <p>After 3 years in, I was promoted to Senior Engineering Manager in September 2020. In this role I managed of a team of both engineers and technicians in the MPD 
            departement.
            </p>

            <h1>Education</h1>
            <p>I studied Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a> in West Lafayette, IN and graduated with a B.S. in 2017. 
            I was also able to add several Computer Science courses to my curriculum and learn things like the basics of computing, algorithms, object oriented programming,
            and much more. Luckily, I was also given the opportunity to study abroad at the <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/">University of Queensland</a> in Brisbane, Australia! 
            While there, I took courses in advanced thermodynamics, material properties, and circuits.
